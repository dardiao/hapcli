//! Lean Wasmtime runtime for hapcli native Wasm plugins.
//!
//! This crate intentionally owns only the Wasm execution boundary: entry path
//! validation, WASI setup, guest ABI calls, timeout interruption, and outbound
//! frame capture. It must not depend on the host API crate, GPUI, SSH, SFTP, or
//! connection models, so it can be reused by both the main app and the optional
//! sidecar binary.
